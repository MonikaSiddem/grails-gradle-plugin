# Change Log

## v2.0.1

+ Fix a bug in setting `grails.groovyVersion` which resulted in an exception when a dependency tried to include the
  `groovy` library.
+ Fix a bug where when a GrailsTestTask is configured with both a set of Task Inputs and a `testResultsDir` that
  results in an exception because `testResultsDir` is a directory but Gradle expects it to be a file.
+ Fix a bug in the task dependency configuration for the `clean` task that results in Gradle being unabled to determine
  the task graph.
+ Add plugin Zip file or application War file as an output file to the runtime configuration.
+ Configured the default configuration to extend from runtime (similar to Java plugin behavior)
