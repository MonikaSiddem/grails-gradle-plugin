By default @GrailsTask@s will send their output and error stream to @System.out@ and @System.err@ respectively.
However, any task can be configured to instead capture their output to the @Logger.INFO@ level by setting the
@captureOutputToInfo@ property to @true@ on the task. When enabled, the task will capture its output and error streams
to a buffer. If the task encounters an error, then both the output and error streams will be rendered onto @System.out@
and @System.err@ respectively.

This allows a successful build to minimize the amount of logging produced to the console during the build and also
allows the output from failed tasks in a parallel multi-project build to rendered their output without interleaving
it with the output of other tasks.

The property can be configured on all @GrailsTask@ instances using the following:

{code}
project.tasks.withType(GrailsTask) {
  captureOutputToInfo = true
}
