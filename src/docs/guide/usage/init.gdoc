Once the plugin is applied, a new Grails project can be initialized through Gradle.

{code}
$ gradle init //Initializes a Grails application
{code}

OR

{code}
$ gradle init-plugin //Initializes a Grails plugin
{code}

Both tasks initialize the Grails project in the current working directory.

{note}
The plugin initializes the application/plugin with the name of the Gradle project and the current Gradle project version
