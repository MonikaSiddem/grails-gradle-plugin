The plugin configures a Gradle Task Rule to allow execution of any available Grails scripts as Gradle tasks. Simply
prefix the Grails script name with @grails-@ and execute from Gradle.

{code}
$ gradle grails-refresh-dependencies
{code}

{note}
Similar to the behavior of Grails itself, the provided script will be passed as the execution for Grails. If the
requested script is provided via a Grails plugin that is not yet installed, then the execution will fail because plugin
resolution in Grails occurs after validating the script. This can be avoided by executing a @gradle assemble@ so that
Grails compilation & plugin resolution occurs after adding a new Grails plugin to the build dependencies.
